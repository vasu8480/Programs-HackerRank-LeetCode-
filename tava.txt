#Covid-19 is discoverd in 2019.
#coronavirus is a family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
#coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
#most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
#older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
#the best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
#the COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
#at this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.
#people can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
#symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.
#stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
#national and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
#keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Local and national authorities and public health units are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.
#to prevent the spread of COVID-19:
*clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
*maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
*wash your hands regularly.
*cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
*stay home if you feel unwell.
*if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
#avoiding unneeded visits to medical facilities allows healthcare systems to operate more effectively and helps protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
#stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider.
#practice respiratory hygiene.
#if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early, but call by telephone first.
#stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider.
